How to install the ChallengeYourself Plugin:

1) Import the "ChallengeYourself2016.unitypackage" to your project
	Alternatively: Copy the folder "ChallengeYourselfPlugin" in the Assets folder of your Unity3D project

2) "TestScriptChallengeYourself.cs" shows both ways to use the plugin:
	
	2a) Drag and Drop the "CY_ Neural Network Node.prefab" to your scene and configure it in the engine
	
	2b) Call the CY-library functions directly
	
	Both variants are shown in examples within the TestScript.
	Alternatively, you can directly start by just importing the "ChallengeYourselfTestScene.unity"
	Have fun,
